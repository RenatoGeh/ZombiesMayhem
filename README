ZOMBIES MAYHEM
==============

What is this?
-------------

A sidescroller 2D post-apocalyptic, open-world, possibly-multiplayer, possibly-couch-multiplayer,
zombies survival, adventure, action, metal slug inspired, retro, indie, psychological horror,
plot-heavy, puzzle, immersive, realistic, cartoonish, highly-customizable, open-source, java
coded, SWING, probably-but-not-really-cross-platform, (not-)mobile, (not-)web, inneficient, code
bloated, with pseudo-ambient occlusion and pseudo-blur, CPU intensive game with an emphasis on plot
twists and code inneficiency.

When was this?
--------------

This project was created in 2012 during a period when we thought we could code.

ZM was hosted at Java.net. Since they're closing it we've migrated to git. When I say migrate I
mean upload it to GitHub, walk away and never look back.

We who?
